## 📖 Project Summary
This project explores the factors that make a dish popular using data-driven analysis. By leveraging recipe datasets containing attributes such as ingredients, cooking methods, nutritional information, and user ratings, we aim to uncover patterns that distinguish top-rated dishes from others.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling, the project identifies key drivers of popularity — including ingredient combinations, cuisine types, and preparation complexity. The insights derived can help culinary creators and food platforms better understand audience preferences and design recipes that resonate with users.
