## 📖 Project Summary
This project analyzes over **500,000 recipes** and **1.4 million user reviews** from *Food.com* to uncover the key factors that drive recipe popularity and user satisfaction. With countless culinary options online, understanding what makes certain dishes stand out helps guide both content strategy and culinary innovation.

Our analysis focused on discovering the relationships between recipe characteristics — such as ingredient complexity, nutritional composition, and visibility — and their effects on ratings and review counts.

## 🧠 Key Insights
1. **Popularity ≠ Satisfaction:**
   Recipes with high visibility (many reviews) are not always the most highly rated. Wider exposure often leads to a broader range of opinions.
2. **Simplicity Wins:**
   Recipes with around **10–14 ingredients** perform best, balancing flavor variety with practical cooking complexity.
3. **Moderation Matters:**
   Dishes with **balanced nutritional values** (moderate calories, fat, and protein) tend to score higher in satisfaction.
4. **Visibility Bias:**
   Early engagement boosts long-term popularity — recipes that attract initial attention tend to accumulate exponentially more reviews.
